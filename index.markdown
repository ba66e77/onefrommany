The purpose of OneFromMany.us is to find ways to bring Americans together as a people, in spite of our differences, and to realize the promise of the motto which appears on the Great Seal of the United States: From Many, One.

We're just beginning this undertaking. Currently we're looking for ideas and people interested in working with us to make things better. If you have ideas or are interested in joining the effort, please fill out the Contact form below.
